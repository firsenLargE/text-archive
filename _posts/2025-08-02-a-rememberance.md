11 years ago, when I was 12, one of my relatives—my fupu—was complaining to her mother about her older sister, saying she was being dominated because of her poverty. It was around 10 PM. I wasn’t asleep and could hear her crying and expressing how unfair life was. I got so emotional that I silently wept and prayed for her, saying, 'God, if you’re there, please help her. Why do you even matter if you're not there for people like her?'

Now, 11 years later, both her sons are in the US, and she’s the bigmouth. What an irony.
